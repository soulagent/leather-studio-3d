# Leather Studio 3D — Session Context
_Last updated: 2026-06-08 · Current version: v0.0.5 · Reads .lpd (Pattern Designer save format v15; assembly seams/folds consumed)_

---

## What this is

A single-file HTML/CSS/JS app (`index.html`) that loads a finished leather pattern (`.lpd`,
produced by the sibling **Leather Pattern Designer**) and previews the pieces in **3D**.
No build step, no npm; **three.js is vendored locally** in `vendor/` (no CDN) so it runs offline.

It is a **separate product** from the Pattern Designer (own repo). The two share a design
language (the `ui-language` skill) so they look/behave like one family.

This is the **Phase-1 framework skeleton**: render each `.lpd` shape as a FLAT textured panel
laid in the XZ plane (1 unit = 1 mm), with a PBR leather material, camera control, and lighting.

## Architecture

Plain `<script>`s inside `index.html`: `vendor/three.min.js` (UMD → global `THREE`), then
`vendor/OrbitControls.classic.js` (→ `THREE.OrbitControls`), then the app script. **Classic
scripts on purpose** — ES-module `import` is blocked over `file://` in Chromium, so a module
build silently fails when the file is double-clicked. Use `THREE.*` globals; don't reintroduce
`import`/import maps (see DEVLOG v0.0.1 for the bug this fixed). The render loop is kicked off
**last** (after every definition) inside a try, so a GL hiccup can't leave the kernel undefined.

### The `S` state object
One global `S` holds app state: material (`leather`, `roughness`, `thickness`), `stitch` colour,
lighting (`keyLight`, `ambient`), scene toggles (`showGrid`, `wireframe`, `showStitches`, `light`),
`panelMeshes[]` (panel meshes), `stitchMeshes[]` (hole + thread instanced meshes), `threadMesh`
(for live colour), `docName`, and `lastData/lastName` (for rebuilds). `LP.defMargin/defSpacing` =
stitch defaults read from the loaded doc's `settings`.

### Scene graph
`scene` → ambient + key (`DirectionalLight`, casts soft shadow) + fill light, a `ShadowMaterial`
ground plane, a `GridHelper`, and a `patternGroup` that all loaded panel + stitch meshes go into
(so the whole pattern can be recentred/cleared as a unit). `OrbitControls` with damping drives the
camera; `HOME_CAM` + `resetCamera()` frame the origin (bound to **R**).

### The geometry/stitch KERNEL (ported verbatim from the Pattern Designer)
A clearly-marked block holds the authoritative algorithms copied from the main app's `index.html`
(and its `stitch-edge-logic` skill): `cubicPt`/`sampleSeg`/`samplePath`, `roundedRectPathPts`/
`rectRounded`, `shapeEdgeCount`/`edgeStitched`, `stitchRect`/`stitchCircle`/`stitchPath`/`stitchFor`.
**Keep in sync with the main app** — only the margin/spacing defaults are rebound from `S.*` to
`LP.*`. Coordinates are mm, Y-down (SVG convention).

### The `.lpd` → 3D pipeline (`loadPattern` → `outlinePolygon` → ExtrudeGeometry + stitches)
1. `loadPattern(data, name, keepCam)` clears the scene, sets `LP` defaults from `data.settings`,
   then for each non-hidden shape builds a panel and collects its stitches.
2. `outlinePolygon(sh)` → a sampled **mm polygon**:
   - **rect** → sharp 4-corner, or `samplePath(roundedRectPathPts(sh))` when `radii` are set.
   - **circle** → 72-point ring (`cx,cy,r`, falling back to `x,y,w,h`).
   - **path** → **true bezier** sampled per cubic segment (uses `points` + cp handles), closed
     into a fillable panel. (This is the v0.0.2 pen-render fix — the old code read `sh.pts`.)
   - **text** / unknown → skipped.
3. `shapeFromPolygon` → `THREE.Shape`; extruded by `S.thickness`, rotated flat (shape XY → world
   XZ, **top face at world y = thickness**), shared `leatherMaterial()`.
4. `collectStitches(sh)` runs `stitchFor(sh)` → hole points; `addHoleMesh` (instanced cylinders
   sunk into the top) + `addThreadMesh` (instanced thread-coloured cylinders between consecutive
   holes within ~1.8×spacing). Stitch meshes honour `S.showStitches`.
5. `recentrePattern()` centres the group; `resetCamera()` frames it (unless `keepCam`).

### Live edits (no reload)
- `applyMaterials()` — colour / roughness / wireframe re-applied to every panel mesh.
- `applyStitchColor()` — thread colour. `applyStitch()` — stitch visibility (menu ↔ checkbox sync).
- `rebuild()` — full rebuild from `lastData` keeping the camera (used on **thickness** change,
  since hole/thread Y depends on thickness).
- `applyLighting()` — key/ambient intensities. `applyGrid()` — grid visibility.
  `applyTheme()` — `body.light` + scene background + grid recolour.
- `flash(msg)` — status-bar success flash (~2.6s) per the ui-language feedback rule.

### Input
File ▸ Open (`<input type=file>`), drag-and-drop a `.lpd` onto the canvas, **Ctrl/Cmd+O**, **R**
reset camera. Menubar dropdowns (File / View) follow the shared menu pattern.

## The crux / known gaps (READ before planning Phase 2+)

- **`.lpd` assembly/seam metadata — now authored AND consumed (Phase 2a shipped in code).**
  Historically `.lpd` was a purely 2D document (cut shapes + stitch lines, nothing saying which
  edge joins which). As of Pattern Designer **v0.8.3** it carries a full `assembly` model, and as
  of **S0 (this app)** we read it: `buildAssembly(data)` resolves each seam member `{shape,edge}`
  to a directed edge polyline via the shared `sampleEdge` kernel, builds a seam **graph**
  (nodes=pieces, arcs=seams), and derives a Tier-1 **problems** list (length-mismatch / dangling /
  incomplete). `buildSeamOverlays()` draws Phase-2a **flat** connectors (coloured ribbons between
  paired edges, red on problem) + dashed **fold** creases; per-piece `thickness` now drives each
  panel's extrude depth + its stitch height. State: `S.assembly`/`S.seamMeshes`/`S.problems`/
  `S.showSeams`. **S1–S2 add a STACKED layout** (`S.assemblyMode`, `S.pieceGroups`, `S.pieceXf`):
  each piece is its own `THREE.Group`; `align2D` gives the in-plane rigid transform that snaps one
  seam member's mated edge onto another's. `computePieceTransforms` (S2) does **whole-graph BFS** from
  the most-connected root: every reachable piece snaps onto its parent and stacks by global layer
  order (cumulative thickness), handling **N-way spines** (3+ on a seam) and multi-seam pieces; the
  traversal is a spanning tree and cycles are **flagged not forced** — `computeSeamGaps` raises a
  **Tier-2 'gap'** problem where mated edges don't coincide. **S3 adds folding** (Phase 2b): each piece
  group is matrix-driven (`poseMatrix`); `computeAssembledMatrices(t)` does forward kinematics down the
  seam tree (`S.pieceTree`) — each child folds about its parent's shared edge by `foldAngle·t`, carrying
  its subtree (`Wc = Wp·Hinge·rel`, t=0 == stacked). A **Flat/Stacked/Assembled** toggle + an
  **Assemble** slider (`S.assembleT`) and **Fold angle** (`S.foldAngle`) drive it; overlays map through
  each group's matrix so they bend too. **Deferred:** per-crease (`fold.angle`) bending needs panel
  splitting; closed-loop closure stays Phase-2c (template-first). Folding remains 2D→3D-ill-posed in
  general; tractable path =
  hinge tree for tree-structured goods, parametric catalogue for closed loops. Consume `assembly`
  **read-only**; absent `assembly` (any pre-v15 file) → flat viewer unchanged.

  **Data model spec.** `.lpd` **schema
  v15** adds a top-level `assembly` object (named seam groups of edges → N-way joins; `type`
  stitch/fold/glue; `folds[]`; per-piece `thickness`), built on the existing **`{shape:id, edge:int}`**
  primitive. Crucially that edge index **means the same geometry here as in the editor**, because we
  ported the stitch-edge kernel verbatim — rect `0=top/1=right/2=bottom/3=left`, path edge `e` = seg
  `points[e]→[e+1]`, circle = 0 edges. **Contract doc (owns the schema): `Leather Stuff/MD
  files/SEAM-MODEL.md`.** **Our consumption design (how we fold/preview + flag problems):
  `MD files/SEAM-CONSUMPTION.md`** — phased 2a (seam-aware flat view + problem flags, ship first) →
  2b (rigid hinge-tree fold + assemble animation) → 2c (constrained/template close, deferred). We
  consume `assembly` **read-only**; absent `assembly` (any pre-v15 file) → today's flat viewer
  unchanged. Keep both docs + both loaders in sync if edge indexing or the schema ever changes.

## Backlog / TODOs

- ✅ **Bezier paths** — DONE v0.0.2 (`outlinePolygon` samples cubic segments).
- ✅ **Stitch holes + thread** — DONE v0.0.2 (ported kernel + instanced hole/thread meshes).
- ✅ **Smoke tests** — DONE v0.0.2 (`tests/run-smoke.ps1` + `run-build-smoke.ps1`).
- ✅ **Desktop wrapper** — DONE v0.0.2 (`desktop/`, Tauri v2; not yet built).
1. **Sample library**: ship more real `.lpd` files in `samples/` (have `demo-card-pocket.lpd`).
2. **Themed dialogs**: add `confirmModal`/`alertModal` (currently only status-bar flashes) per
   the ui-language skill before any destructive/decision flows.
3. **Saddle-stitch realism**: alternate front/back thread passes + slanted slits (current thread is
   a simple cylinder between holes; holes are surface discs, not boolean-punched).
4. **Desktop follow-ups**: ✅ auto-update DONE (updater plugin + signing key + `release.yml`;
   `checkForUpdates()` in index.html; see DEVLOG). Remaining: native Open/Save dialogs (optional —
   the HTML file input works in WebView2); a paid Authenticode cert to silence SmartScreen.
5. **Thickness**: `rebuild()` re-runs the loader on change; fine, but a partial update would be
   cheaper if perf matters on big patterns.

## Conventions

- **Append a DEVLOG entry every session**; bump `APP_VERSION` in `index.html` and the version line
  in this file + SHORTCUTS.md together.
- **All new UI follows the `ui-language` skill** — dark-first tokens + `body.light` override, one
  red accent, themed dialogs (never native), status flash for success.
- **three.js stays vendored as classic scripts** (no CDN, no ES modules — they break over
  `file://`). To upgrade, re-download the UMD build + classic OrbitControls into `vendor/` at a
  version that still ships both (≤ r0.147.0).
